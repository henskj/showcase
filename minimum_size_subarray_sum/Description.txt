Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a
subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.


Constraints:

    1 <= target <= 10^9
    1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
    1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

Solution:
I used a sliding window with two pointers to move across the list one index at a time, keeping a sum of the current window as an int.
